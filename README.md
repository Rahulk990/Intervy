# Intervy: Self Analysis Website

Intervy is a simple _self analysis_ website for any student who wants to track his performance while preparaing for the interviews. It is common that the students practice coding on various platforms and finally, end up doing the same set of questions on all the platforms. To deal with this, the site integrates the questions from various platforms to help students track their actual progress.

## _Future Considerations_

- Performance on more coding platforms can be included like GfG, InterviewBit
- Various other charts (like Daily progress, coding streak) can be included
- Machine Learning models can be used to suggest questions and predict progress

## _Issues_

- Extracting Data from other coding platforms without APIs
